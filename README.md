# SQL-projects
I used an SQL database for some side projects (business problems). Please see the documentation in the Word file in this repository. 

This SQL database - "chinook" was downloaded from https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/. This database contains tables about a hypothetical music store, including customers, invoices, tracks, albums, playlists ... etc. Please go to the website for a more detailed explanation of each table. 

I may upload new SQL files to this repository if I do new side projects using this database.
